### Hi there

### I am a junior programmer from Belarus. I've been programming for fun for many years, but since 2023 year I made programming my main job and source of income.

### My main programming language is PHP, but sometimes I also use JS. I also tried to write a little in other languages such as ะก#, TypeScript, Pascal, Python, Java.
